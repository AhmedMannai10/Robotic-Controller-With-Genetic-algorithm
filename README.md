## Overview
Welcome to our Maze Navigation project! The primary goal is to guide a robot through a maze using a genetically evolved controller. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and how genetic algorithms are employed for optimization.

## Project Details
### Core Features
- **Robot Actions:** Move forward, turn left, turn right, and stationary.
- **Sensors:** Six sensorsâ€”three front, one left, one right, and one back.
- **Maze Challenge:** Navigate through a maze with impassable walls.

### Genetic Algorithms
- **Optimization:** Automatically evolve a robust controller using genetic algorithms.
- **Fitness Function:** Evaluate the controller's performance through simulations.
- **Evolution Process:** Explore how genetic algorithms gradually improve the controller over generations.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine. Ensure you have Java installed.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmedMannai10/Simple_Genetic_Algorithm.git
   cd Simple_Genetic_Algorithm
